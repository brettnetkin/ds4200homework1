    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Brett Netkin. You'll find some of my interests below:</p>

    <ul> 
      <li>golf</li>
      <li>football</li>
      <li>reading</li>
      <li>finance</li>
      <li>computer science</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am from Springfield, New Jersey, about one hour south of New York City. I am a huge New York sports fan, including the Mets, Jets, Knicks, and Rangers. I follow golf
        as well and am a huge supporter of Viktor Hovland. In addition, I track the markets very closely and enjoy reading about finance. In my free time, I frequently play
        golf, as it is my goal to play in the 2025 U.S. Open Qualifier. I also enjoy spending time with family as much as possible.
    </p>
    
    <p>Below, you'll find some things I'd like to include on my website later on:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>More interactive buttons</li>
        <li>A market tracker</li>
        <li>More images and background about me!</li>
      </ul>
